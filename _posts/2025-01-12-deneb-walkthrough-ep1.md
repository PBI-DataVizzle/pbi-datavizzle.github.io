## Acknowledgements
Before we begin, I’d like to tag and thank Deneb creator Daniel Marsh-Patrick — you can find comprehensive Deneb resources and examples at the offical website: deneb-viz.github.io. Daniel has inspired innumerable Power BI developers around the world, enabling us to go far beyond the boundaries of “traditional” Power BI report design. This article is a celebration of Daniel’s endeavours, for which I owe my sincere gratitude 🤓🙌
