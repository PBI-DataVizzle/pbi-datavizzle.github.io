## Acknowledgements
Before we begin, I’d like to tag and thank Deneb creator Daniel Marsh-Patrick — you can find comprehensive Deneb resources and examples at the offical website: deneb-viz.github.io. Daniel has inspired innumerable Power BI developers around the world, enabling us to go far beyond the boundaries of “traditional” Power BI report design. This article is a celebration of Daniel’s endeavours, for which I owe my sincere gratitude 🤓🙌

## Getting Started
When embarking on any new learning journey, it’s only natural that we want to create the most amazing, dazzling designs. However, despite our eagerness to unlock new skills and talents, it is absolutely necessary to begin by taking baby steps 🐣… and Vega-Lite is no exception.

It can at first be overwhelming, particularly when viewing the Vega-Lite examples gallery

I know what you are thinking:

> *“But I just want to make a simple line chart 😭… what happened to my clicky-clicky-draggy-droppy experience?!”*


Well, Vega-Lite is incredibly powerful and versatile… but it does require some extra effort. In order to put our chart design ideas into practice, we must get to grips with JSON, and Vega-Lite’s grammar and syntax. It will enable you to build charts which overcome many of the limitations we find in native Power BI visuals. Are you ready to get stuck in? 🧙‍♂️
